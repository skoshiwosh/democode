# democode
I developed some of these python scripts for my own use. 
Other scripts herein are intended for teaching python. 
I am planning to add improvements. 
This is my first git repository on GitHub. Iâ€™m just getting started with organization. 

ToDo: 
- Aside from code improvements, revise documentation to standard using either Doxygen or Sphinx.
- Improve organization, possibly adding other repositories (or branches).

Files:

python_docs.pdf
- list of links to important web docs on Python, PySide2 and Maya Python commands

python_class_outline.pdf
- my own class outline proposal for teaching python and technical infrastructure to visual effects students
- this does not necessarily correlate with python course taught at specific institutions

scriptinfo.pdf
- description of example python scripts to be used for teaching Python

templatescript.py, demoscript.py, seqtypes.py
- these are described in scriptinfo.pdf

running_pythonscripts.pdf
- demo using templatescript.py to show difference between running script directly from command line or from imported module

upv.py
- Copy file argument with added version suffix to base name and save in versions subdirectory
- upv.py allows user input version suffix and uses regular expression module, re, to parse

findtabs.py
- parse python scripts for hard-tabs from input top-level directory 

patterns_web.py, src_html.py
- Create web page containing images using templates from module, src_html.py

makecity.py, makecity_description.pdf
- makecity.py copies geo over grid and randomizes scale on each geo. Result can be interpreted as low resolution CG city environment.
- makecity_description.pdf describes script with screen grabs and suggests improvements.
