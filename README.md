# democode
I developed these python scripts for my own use. 
However, I may use these as examples for teaching python. 
I am planning to add improvements. 
This is my first git repository on GitHub. Iâ€™m just getting started with organization. 

ToDo: 
- Aside from code improvements, revise documentation to standard using either Doxygen or Sphinx

Files:

verup.py 
- Copy file argument with added version suffix to base name and save in versions subdirectory

patterns_web.py, src_html.py
- Create web page containing images using templates from module, src_html.py

collager.py
- Launch window to create mirrored tiled images from source image file
- Look at collager_init.png and collager_done.png
